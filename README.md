Guess Num
=========

This is the classic number guessing game, often used as an exercise in
programming classes. 

In this case I wrote this as an example of using a class in the
solution, written using test-driven development.  It's also an example
of styles and documentation that are helpful when writing code,
particularly for larger projects.  For the most part this code is PEP8
and pylint compliant.

To run
======

    ./test_guess_num2.py
    ./guess_num2.py
    ./guess_num2.py --max=200
